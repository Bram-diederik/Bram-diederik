My Home assistant server running on a raspberry PI 4. I use snapcast and raspberry pi's for a multi room speaker environment. Mainly with use with mpd that can be controlled by sascha. 


# Sascha
My phone assistant asterisk scripts.  If im busy my phone redirects to my landline connected to asterisk and tells the caller im busy. With options to leave a voicemail and certain contacts can call me anyway.

# Gnomepub and Hushhush

- I did not find a good VPN system that allowes a anonymous vpn connection to the internet but with access to your local network. 
- Gnomepub is a normal openvpn/wireguard vpn server but with special ip rules
- rules redirect all network from the incomming vpn clients to hushhush
- hushhush is connected to a single vpn server forwarding incoming network over that vpn.
