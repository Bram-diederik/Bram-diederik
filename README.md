# Hushhush

- I did not find a good VPN system that allowes a anonymous vpn connection to the internet but with access to your local network. 
- hushhush is connected to a single vpn server forwarding incoming network over that vpn.
- It comes with rules to make the vpn be used by incomming vpns but i dont use that anymore.

With inspiration of the hushhush setup i made code for doorman to select route and dns for ip addesses. 
off course with home assistant integration. 
Block internet to a device. Set your kids devices to limited access when its time for home work. Get VPN on selected clients with out client config. all posiblilities.
